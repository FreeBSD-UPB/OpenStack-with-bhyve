        list will have its first element be the Selection object representing

        zero or more alternate objects that could also satisfy the request. The
        number of alternates is determined by the configuration option

        The ability of a calling method to handle this format of returned
        destinations is indicated by a True value in the parameter

        a deployment that have not been updated to Queens, and in that case
        return_objects will be False, and the result will be a list of dicts
        with 'host', 'nodename' and 'limits' as keys. When return_objects is
        False, the value of return_alternates has no effect. The reason there
        are two kwarg parameters return_objects and return_alternates is so we
        can differentiate between callers that understand the Selection object
        format but *don't* want to get alternate hosts, as is the case with the
