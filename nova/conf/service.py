Maximum time in seconds since last check-in for up service

Each compute node periodically updates their database status based on the
specified report interval. If the compute node hasn't updated the status
for more than service_down_time, then the compute node is considered down.

Enable periodic tasks.

If set to true, this option allows services to periodically run tasks
on the manager.

In case of running multiple schedulers or conductors you may want to run
periodic tasks on only one host - in this case disable this option for all

Number of seconds to randomly delay when starting the periodic task
scheduler to reduce stampeding.

When compute workers are restarted in unison across a cluster,
they all end up running the periodic tasks at the same time
causing problems for the external services. To mitigate this
behavior, periodic_fuzzy_delay option allows you to introduce a
random initial delay when starting the periodic task scheduler.
