This option allows setting an alternate timeout value for RPC calls
that have the potential to take a long time. If set, RPC calls to
other services will use this value for the timeout (in seconds)
instead of the global rpc_response_timeout value.

Operations with RPC calls that utilize this value:

* live migration
* scheduling
* enabling/disabling a compute service
* volume attach

Related options:

* rpc_response_timeout
