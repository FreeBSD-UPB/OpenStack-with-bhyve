The vGPU types enabled in the compute node.

Some pGPUs (e.g. NVIDIA GRID K1) support different vGPU types. User can use
this option to specify a list of enabled vGPU types that may be assigned to a
guest instance. But please note that Nova only supports a single type in the
Queens release. If more than one vGPU type is specified (as a comma-separated
list), only the first one will be used. An example is as the following::

    [devices]
    enabled_vgpu_types = GRID K100,Intel GVT-g,MxGPU.2,nvidia-11
""")
]


def register_opts(conf):
    conf.register_group(devices_group)
    conf.register_opts(vgpu_opts, group=devices_group)


def list_opts():
    return {devices_group: vgpu_opts}
