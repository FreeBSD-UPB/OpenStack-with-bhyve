The final weight will be:

    ``(name1.value * 1.0) + (name2.value * -1.3)``

This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
a different scheduler, this option has no effect.

Possible values:

* A list of zero or more key/value pairs separated by commas, where the key is
  a string representing the name of a metric and the value is a numeric weight
  for that metric. If any value is set to 0, the value is ignored and the
  weight will be set to the value of the 'weight_of_unavailable' option.

This setting determines how any unavailable metrics are treated. If this option
is set to True, any hosts for which a metric is unavailable will raise an
exception, so it is recommended to also use the MetricFilter to filter out
those hosts before weighing.

This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
a different scheduler, this option has no effect.

Possible values:

* True or False, where False ensures any metric being unavailable for a host
  will set the host weight to 'weight_of_unavailable'.

When any of the following conditions are met, this value will be used in place
of any actual metric value:

* One of the metrics named in 'weight_setting' is not available for a host,
  and the value of 'required' is False
* The ratio specified for a metric in 'weight_setting' is 0
* The 'weight_multiplier' option is set to 0

This option is only used by the FilterScheduler and its subclasses; if you use
a different scheduler, this option has no effect.

Possible values:

* An integer or float value, where the value corresponds to the multipler
  ratio for this weigher.
