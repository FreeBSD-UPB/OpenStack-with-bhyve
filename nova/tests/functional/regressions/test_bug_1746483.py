    The IsolatedHostsFilter checks for images restricted to certain hosts via
    config options. When creating a server from a root volume, the image is
    in the volume (and it's related metadata from Cinder). When creating a
    volume-backed server, the imageRef is not required.

    The regression is that the RequestSpec.image.id field is not set and the
    IsolatedHostsFilter blows up trying to load the image id.
