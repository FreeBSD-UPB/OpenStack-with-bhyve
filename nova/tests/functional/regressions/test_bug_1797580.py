    """Regression test for bug 1797580 introduced in Queens.

    Microversion 2.56 allows cold migrating to a specified target host. The
    compute API sets the requested destination on the request spec with the
    specified target host and then conductor sends that request spec to the
    scheduler to validate the host. Conductor later persists the changes to
    the request spec because it's the resize flow and the flavor could change
    (even though in this case it won't since it's a cold migrate). After
    confirming the resize, if the server is live migrated it will fail during
    scheduling because of the persisted RequestSpec.requested_destination
    from the cold migration, and you can't live migrate to the same host on
    which the instance is currently running.

    This test reproduces the regression and will validate the fix.
