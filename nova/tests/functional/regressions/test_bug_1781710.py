    The ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter changed in Rocky to support the
    "max_server_per_host" rule in the group's anti-affinity policy which
    allows having more than one server from the same anti-affinity group
    on the same host. As a result, the scheduler filter logic changed and
    a regression was introduced because of how the FilterScheduler is tracking
    which hosts are selected for each instance in a multi-create request.

    This test uses a custom weigher to ensure that when creating two servers
    in a single request that are in the same anti-affinity group with
    the default "max_server_per_host" setting (1), the servers are split
    across the two hosts even though normally one host would be weighed higher
    than the other.
