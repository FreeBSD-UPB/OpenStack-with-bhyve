    """Regression recreate test for bug 1830747

    Before change I4244f7dd8fe74565180f73684678027067b4506e in Stein, when
    a cold migration would reschedule to conductor it would not send the
    RequestSpec, only the filter_properties. The filter_properties contain
    a primitive version of the instance group information from the RequestSpec
    for things like the group members, hosts and policies, but not the uuid.
    When conductor is trying to reschedule the cold migration without a
    RequestSpec, it builds a RequestSpec from the components it has, like the
    filter_properties. This results in a RequestSpec with an instance_group
    field set but with no uuid field in the RequestSpec.instance_group.
    That RequestSpec gets persisted and then because of change
    Ie70c77db753711e1449e99534d3b83669871943f, later attempts to load the
    RequestSpec from the database will fail because of the missing
    RequestSpec.instance_group.uuid.

    This test recreates the regression scenario by cold migrating a server
    to a host which fails and triggers a reschedule but without the RequestSpec
    so a RequestSpec is created/updated for the instance without the
    instance_group.uuid set which will lead to a failure loading the
    RequestSpec from the DB later.
