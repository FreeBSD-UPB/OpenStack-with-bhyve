    When creating multiple instances at the same time, the RequestSpec record
    is persisting the number of concurrent instances.
    When moving one of those instances, the scheduler should not include
    num_instances > 1 in the request spec.
    It was partially fixed by bug #1708961 but we forgot to amend
    some place in the scheduler so that the right number of hosts was returned
    to the scheduler method calling both the Placement API and filters/weighers
    but we were verifying that returned size of hosts against a wrong number,
    which is the number of instances created concurrently.

    That test will create 2 concurrent instances and verify that when
    live-migrating one of them, we end up with a correct move operation.
