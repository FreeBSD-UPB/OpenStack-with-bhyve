    When evacuating a server, the request to the scheduler should be restricted
    to the cell in which the instance is already running since cross-cell
    evacuate is not supported, at least not yet. This test creates two cells
    with two compute hosts in one cell and another compute host in the other
    cell. A server is created in the cell with two hosts and then evacuated
    which should land it on the other host in that cell, not the other cell
    with only one host. The scheduling behavior is controlled via the custom
    HostNameWeigher.
