    """Regression tests for bug #1741307

    Some scheduler drivers, like the old CachingScheduler driver, do not use
    Placement to make claims (allocations) against compute nodes during
    scheduling like the FilterScheduler does.
    During a cold migrate / resize, the FilterScheduler will "double up" the
    instance allocations so the instance has resource allocations made against
    both the source node and the chosen destination node. Conductor will then
    attempt to "swap" the source node allocation to the migration record. If
    using a non-Placement driver, there are no allocations for the instance on
    the source node and conductor fails. Note that if the compute running the
    instance was running Ocata code or older, then the compute itself would
    create the allocations in Placement via the ResourceTracker, but once all
    computes are upgraded to Pike or newer, the compute no longer creates
    allocations in Placement because it assumes the scheduler is doing that,
    which is not the case with these outlier scheduler drivers.

    This is a regression test to show the failure before it's fixed and then
    can be used to confirm the fix.
