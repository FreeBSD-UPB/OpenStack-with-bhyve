    During testing in the alternate host series, it was found that retries
    when resizing an instance would always fail. This turned out to be true
    even before alternate hosts for resize was introduced. Further
    investigation showed that there was a race in call to retry the resize
    and the revert of the original attempt.

    This adds a functional regression test to show the failure. A follow up
    patch with the fix will modify the test to show it passing again.
