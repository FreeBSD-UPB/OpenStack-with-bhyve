    """Test the scenario listing instances whose services may not have a UUID.

    We added a UUID field to the 'services' table in Pike, so after an upgrade,
    we generate a UUID and save it to the service record upon access if it's an
    older record that does not already have a UUID.

    Now, when we list instances through the API, the instances query is joined
    with the 'services' table in order to provide service-related information.
    The bug in Pike was that we were already inside of a 'reader' database
    transaction context when we tried to compile the instance list, which
    eventually led to an error:

      TypeError: Can't upgrade a READER transaction to a WRITER mid-transaction

    because we also tried to write the newly generated service UUID to the
    service record while still nested under the 'reader' context.

    This test verifies that we are able to list instances joined with services
    even if the associated service record does not yet have a UUID.
