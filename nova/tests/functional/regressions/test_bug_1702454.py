    """Regression test for bug 1702454 introduced in Newton.

    That test is for verifying that if we evacuate by providing a target, the
    scheduler only checks the related host. If the host is not able to
    accepting the instance, it would return a NoValidHost to the user instead
    of passing the instance to another host.

    Unfortunately, when we wrote the feature for that in Newton, we forgot to
    transform the new RequestSpec field called `requested_destination` into an
    item for the legacy filter_properties dictionary so the scheduler wasn't
    getting it.

    That test will use 3 hosts:
     - host1 which will be the source host for the instance
     - host2 which will be the requested target when evacuating from host1
     - host3 which could potentially be the evacuation target if the scheduler
       doesn't correctly get host2 as the requested destination from the user.
